## Usage

To run Polytextum on a given markdown file run

    pt article yourfile.md

for an article, and this

    pt report yourfile.md

for a report.

Note that the difference between a report and an article is that articles can
have two levels of headings, and that reports can have three (the top level is
turned into a chapter). Reports also have title pages and tables of contents.
